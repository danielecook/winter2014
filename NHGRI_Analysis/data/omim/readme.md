# Omim Database Structure

From the OMIM FAQ

## What numbering system is used in the OMIM database?
Each OMIM entry is given a unique six-digit number as summarized below:

1----- (100000- ) 2----- (200000- ) Autosomal loci or phenotypes (entries created before May 15, 1994)

3----- (300000- ) X-linked loci or phenotypes

4----- (400000- ) Y-linked loci or phenotypes

5----- (500000- ) Mitochondrial loci or phenotypes

6----- (600000- ) Autosomal loci or phenotypes (entries created after May 15, 1994)

Allelic variants (mutations; see 1.4) are designated by the MIM number of the entry, followed by a decimal point and a unique 4-digit variant number. For example, allelic variants in the factor IX gene (300746) are numbered 300746.0001 through 300746.0101.


## What do the symbols preceding a MIM number represent?
An asterisk (*) before an entry number indicates a gene.

A number symbol (#) before an entry number indicates that it is a descriptive entry, usually of a phenotype, and does not represent a unique locus. The reason for the use of the number symbol is given in the first paragraph of the entry. Discussion of any gene(s) related to the phenotype resides in another entry(ies) as described in the first paragraph.

A plus sign (+) before an entry number indicates that the entry contains the description of a gene of known sequence and a phenotype.

A percent sign (%) before an entry number indicates that the entry describes a confirmed mendelian phenotype or phenotypic locus for which the underlying molecular basis is not known.

No symbol before an entry number generally indicates a description of a phenotype for which the mendelian basis, although suspected, has not been clearly established or that the separateness of this phenotype from that in another entry is unclear.

A caret (^) before an entry number means the entry no longer exists because it was removed from the database or moved to another entry as indicated.
